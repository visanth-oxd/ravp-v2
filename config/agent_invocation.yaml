# Agent invocation policy: which agents can invoke which (elevated-permission agents).
# Only listed callers are allowed to invoke each target. Enforced by AgentInvocationGateway.
#
# Security: The target agent (e.g. cloud_healing) has permissions to change resources.
# The caller (e.g. cloud_reliability) has only read-only + permission to submit requests.
# All invocations are audited with caller_agent_id and target_agent_id.

  # Target agent_id -> list of agent_ids allowed to invoke it
