# =============================================================================
# PERSONA VISIBILITY: Which user roles can see which agents?
# =============================================================================
#
# DOMAIN  = A category on each AGENT (set in config/agents/<agent_id>.yaml).
#           Examples: payments, fraud, cloud_platform.
#           Used to group agents in the UI (e.g. "Payments", "Cloud Platform").
#
# PERSONA = A role or "view" assigned to a USER (e.g. business user, cloud ops).
#           Each persona is allowed to see agents only in certain domains.
#           This file defines: "Persona X can see agents whose domain is in this list."
#
# HOW IT'S USED:
#   - API: GET /mesh/agents?persona=business  → returns only agents in domains
#          listed under "business" below (payments, fraud, customer_service).
#   - UI:  If your app knows the current user's persona, call the API with
#          that persona so the user only sees agents they're allowed to see.
#   - platform persona with domains: [] means "see all agents" (no filter).
#
